## Arrival

Friends of mine, [Roderick](https://github.com/RoderickQiu), [Mingzhi](https://github.com/Dilemma-CMZ) and [Luo](https://github.com/wLUOw) accompanied me to the workshop. We departed from Bao'an in about 4pm due to the delay, and arrived at Changi in 9pm. It's not a hot weather as expected in equator area, but the humidity is so low that I felt comfortable. The NUS guys picked us up and went to the Prince George's Park Residences (PGPR). Well, I must admit, the single room is quite small, but at least it's clean and tidy, and the air conditioner is working well fortunately. Heard lots of complaints from the colleagues about the broken air conditioner or blablabla, I'm just lucky enough.

30th is a free day, so we decided to shop for some daily necessities. Mingzhi would like to buy a new blanket, and IKEA is the best choice. Singapore seems narrow as we moved for 10 mins by bus to reach the Queen's Street. Food in IKEA tasted emmmm, but it took a tenner. I wouldn't try again:(. Everything is "cheap" in Singapore, only if you do not convert the currency.

## Week 1

After the welcome dinner, I began my first week at NUS. As a hacker, I chose the "Defense Of The Ancient (DOTA)" without a second thought.
