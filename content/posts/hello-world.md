These days the thoughts of migrating my blog site keeps blowing my mind since
- The server and domain that I rent is going to expire soon, and I don't wanna renew it.
- The previous content is not well-organized, and I dropped them all.
- The only solution is to deploy on GitHub Pages.
- Why not try something new?

> The cactus theme I used in Hexo looks a little bit "classic", good for literal articles but not for tech blogs. So I started over with a new platform, Hugo, and a new theme, Papermod, which is simpler and more modern.

I guess I can write more in the future, but for now, this is it. Hope you like it.
