### Semester Projects
- [[CS 109] Dark Chess](https://github.com/chanbengz/SUSTech_CS109_Project): Dark chess game implemented in Java using Swing GUI, a rookie project.
- [[CS 202] MineCPU](https://github.com/wLUOw/MineCPU): Standard 5-stage pipeline RISC-V CPU implemented in SystemVerilog, with cache and branch prediction as performance optimization, verified by Verilator and Unicorn simulator. As verification of functionality, the project implements a simple game, Pacman, written in C++ and cross-compiled to RV machine code. The I/O interface is integrated into the CPU and driven by MMIO.
- [[CS 207] Piano by FPGA](https://github.com/chanbengz/SUSTech_CS207_Project_Piano): Another rookie project introducing FPGA and Verilog, intended for learning digital design. It's a simple piano running on FPGA with auto-play, learning and free-play modes. Developed on my own.
- [[CS 305] HTTP File Manager](https://github.com/chanbengz/CS305_Project_2023F): Remote file manager implemented in Python to enhance the understanding of HTTP protocol along with TCP/IP for computer networks. The framework is built from scratch since the instructor requires no third-party libraries.

### Notes
- [CS Notes @SUSTech](https://github.com/chanbengz/SUSTech_CS_Notes): Course notes and materials during my undergraduate study at SUSTech, mainly for computer science.
- [WriteUps for CTF](https://github.com/chanbengz/CTF_Writeups): Collection of my personal writeups (aka solutions) for CTF challenges. I will also post them on my blog.
