### Semester Projects
- [[CS 109] Dark Chess](https://github.com/chanbengz/SUSTech_CS109_Project): Dark chess game implemented in Java using Swing GUI, a rookie project.
- [[CS 202] MineCPU](https://github.com/wLUOw/MineCPU): Standard 5-stage pipeline RISC-V CPU implemented in SystemVerilog, with cache and branch prediction as performance optimization, verified by Verilator and Unicorn simulator. As verification of functionality, the project implements a simple game, Pacman, written in C++ and cross-compiled to RV machine code. The I/O interface is integrated into the CPU and driven by MMIO.
- [[CS 207] Piano by FPGA](https://github.com/chanbengz/SUSTech_CS207_Project_Piano): Another rookie project introducing FPGA and Verilog, intended for learning digital design. It's a simple piano running on FPGA with auto-play, learning and free-play modes. Developed on my own.
- [[CS 301] ShinxSU7](https://github.com/SUSTech-ISACG-Association/ShinxSU7): A STM32-based robot car developed in C, with a variety of sensors and actuators, including ultrasonic, infrared, motor and bluetooth connected to a MiniSTM32 board as controller.
- [[CS 303] AI Compilation](https://github.com/chanbengz/SUSTech_CS303_Project_2024F): Three subprojects in CS303 Artificial Intelligence, including a Information Exposure Maximization (IEM) algorithm, image classifier and knowledge graph-based recommendation system.
- [[CS 304] Software Engineering](https://github.com/chanbengz): To be determined.
- [[CS 305] HTTP File Manager](https://github.com/chanbengz/SUSTech_CS305_Project_2023F): Remote file manager implemented in Python to enhance the understanding of HTTP protocol along with TCP/IP for computer networks. The framework is built from scratch since the instructor requires no third-party libraries.
- [[CS 309] NINJA Chat](https://github.com/SUSTech-NINJA): A LLM chat web application developed in Vite and Flask.
- [[CS 323] Incredibuild](https://github.com/chanbengz/SUSTech_CS323_Project_Incredibuild): A toy compiler written in Rust and LLVM, implements a subset of C language, which is called SUSTech Programming Language (SPL).
- [[SWS 3011] GoFetch Demo & Mitigation](https://github.com/chanbengz/NUS_SoC_SWS_2024_DOTA_GP5): A educational website developed to give a first glance at the side-channel attack, and animate the GoFetch attack. Then it showed a possible hardware and software mitigation to defend against the attack. Meanwhile the overhead of the mitigation is also discussed.

### Notes
- [CS Notes @SUSTech](https://github.com/chanbengz/sustech-notes): Course notes and materials during my undergraduate study at SUSTech, mainly for computer science.
- [Write Up for CTF](https://github.com/chanbengz/ctf-writeups): Collection of my personal writeups (aka solutions) for CTF challenges. I've also post them on the blog.
- [Slides @Slidev](https://github.com/chanbengz/slides): Slides for presentations, mainly for academic purposes.
